# My very simple but super ultra fun chat app

This is just a little app to get started on learning a bit of `node.js` with `express` and `socket.io`. This project is deployed [here](https://gkarolyi-simple-chat.herokuapp.com/).

### Project goals:

- [x] add proper support for nicknames
- [x] messages should be inserted locally for the sender and not sent back via `socket`
- [ ] typing indicator
- [ ] choice of rooms with indicators of participants
- [x] private messages
- [x] Tailwind CSS
